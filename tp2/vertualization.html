<p><h1>Virtualization</h1>
<br>
<p> In computing,<b>virtualization</b> refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, this includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.

<p>
<h1> Levels of Virtualization</h1>
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li><h4>Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) level</h4></li>
Every machine has an instruction set . This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware.Using this instructions software can communicate with hardware.
<li><h4>Virtualization at Operating System(O.S.) level</h4></li>
In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc.
</ol>
<ul>
        <li type="circle">In cloud sometimes we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, If we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer(HAL) level this can take too much time.</li>
        <li type="circle">So to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware. </li>
</ul>
